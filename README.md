# Space Travelers' Hub

> CSpace Travelers' Hub is a single page app to view and read about the SpaceX latest rockets and missions from SpaceX API. You can reserve rockets and join their missions. We built this app with React and we used Redux as a state management library. For testing we used react-testing-library with Jest, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
